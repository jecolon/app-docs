# COVID19 Update
COVID19 Update is a mobile app (Android &amp; iOS) that displays current statistics about the COVID-19 disease.

The app displays current reported cases and deaths related to COVID-19. With this data, it calculates a mortality
rate and applies it to the aproximate total world population. This provides a projection of the total deaths that
could be reached in the event of 100% worldwide contagion. Statistics in the app are gathered from 
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (worldometer) and the United Nations world population data at
https://population.un.org/wpp/DataQuery/ .
