# PonPin
PonPin is a mobile app (Android &amp; iOS) that lets you share and store your favorite locations easily.

Unlike having to fiddle around with a maps app, where dropping a pin isn't always accurate, PonPin lets you share and store
your exact GPS coordinates easily. Just open the app, and inmediately you're ready to share or save your location. You can also
re-share your previously saved locations easily.
