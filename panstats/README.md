# PanStats
PanStats is a mobile app that displays current statistics about the Coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.

It displays statistics via the API provided by https://github.com/novelcovid/api , that exposes the
data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html . The app
displays total world statistics, as well as per country and US States/Territories.

You can find the Android APK files in the apks folder. Note you will have to enable unknown sources on your
device in order to install the APK. Most modern phones will use the arm64 version. You will also most likely
receive warnings from Google Play Protect. You will have to act accordingly when prompted to install the app.
